# switch-wikiwand-bookmarks

Little script to get rid of wikiwand links in *Firefox* bookmarks and replace them with real wikipedia links.

Usage:  
1. export your bookmarks ("backup" in the Manage Bookmarks tool)
2. run the [script](./switch_wiki_bookmarks.py) after editing the json filenames in top of it
3. import the new bookmarks file into firefox !

Note:
    Wikiwand not only uses "normal" /en/articlename URLs, but also /simple/ etc.
    This script only deals with "normal" articles

I used wikiwand for some time and then decided to ditch it and go back to wikipedia
(using an addon that doesn't force me to use another website and just enhances wikipedia).  

Now i finally wanted to clean my bookmarks without losing the links, i. e. turning them into wikipedia links.
